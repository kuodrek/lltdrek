# LLTDREK CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
- Following [text](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## TODO

- Create AirfoilDatabase object
  - Maybe use a dataframe library
- Create input data interface
  - Add airfoil data by yaml files
- move setup_airfoil_data method from Wing to WingPool
- Wing.generate_mesh() should automatically be called by wing pool
- Rewrite `PostProcessing.get_CLmax_linear` method

## [Unreleased]

## 1.2.0

### Changed
- Update directory structure
- Update code dependencies

## 1.1.0

### Added
- Add Notebook with aerodynamic center calculation example
- Add show logs option for many functions
- Add verification if reynolds number or angle of attack is out of bounds in airfoil data
- Add setter method for `WingPool.moment_ref`
  - Needed for aerodynamic center calculations, since changing `WingPool.moment_ref` changes freestream system velocities
- Add `ForceCoefficients` and `MomentCoefficients` to simplify coefficient access
- Add class `AerodynamicCenter`, related to `PostProcessing.get_aerodynamic_center`


### Changed
- Update `PostProcessing.get_aerodynamic_center` to work with new version
- Remove unused function `lookup.find_closest`
- Display `Coefficient` results as `ForceCoefficients` and `MomentCoefficients`
- Remove `PostProcessing.get_wing_coefficients` and `PostProcessing.get_CLmax_linear` methods

## 1.0.0

The main objective of these changes is to make the process of getting coefficients easier

- Now, simulation returns a `SimulationResult` object. In order to obtain coefficients, simply
pass this object to `PostProcessing.get_coefficients` along with its related `wing_pool` to obtain
local and global aerodynamic coefficients!

- It is possible to run simulations with angular rates (roll, pitch, yaw)
  - The linear velocity components generated by angular rates are added in system freestream velocity
  - Wing pool calculates system distribution velocities (freestream, angular) rather than using a single array
- Add pre-commit configuration file

### Added
- Exceptions
  - `AlphaNotFoundException`
  - `NonUniqueWingsException`
- Documentation
- `Simulation`
  - Changed main method to `run`
  - `SimulationModes`: Represent ways of running a simulation
  - `SimulationResult`: Container class that has simulation results
- Types
  - `AngleOfAttack`
  - `DVS` (Dimensionless Vortex Strength)
- `WingPool`
  - Add `_build_system_moment_ref` for precalculating panel distances to a moment reference
- `PostProcessing`
  - Now has class methods for post processing simulation results
  - `Coefficients`: Container class for Aerodynamic Coefficients
  - `ProcessedSimulationResults`: Processed simulation results; Contains global and local coefficients
- Notebook folder
- Simulation with angular rates
- Pre-commit configuration
### Changed
- Changed main directory to `src`
- Imports in `__init__.py`
- Renamed class attributes
- Build system freestream and angular velocities instead of using only one array

## 0.2.1

### Added

- Add build tests for multiple python versions
    - Some users were reporting problems using python with these versions. Might be a dependency problem.
- Get dependencies from requirements.txt file in pyproject.toml

### Changed

- Also update requirements
